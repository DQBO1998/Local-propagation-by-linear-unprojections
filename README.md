### Summary
An alternative to back-prop based on an idea proposed by [NÃ¸kland and Eidnes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06656), where 
each layer of a neural network is trained independently of the others. Once an inference signal goes through the network, 
each layer receives a separate learning signal.
