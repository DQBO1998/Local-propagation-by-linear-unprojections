### Summary
This is one of many (independent) exploratory projects in the search for an alternative to back-propagation. Since it is
an ongoing effort, do not expect to find anything conclusive (not yet, at least).

The approach explored here is based on an idea proposed by [NÃ¸kland and Eidnes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06656), where 
each layer of a neural network is trained independently of the others. Once an inference signal goes through the network, 
each layer receives a separate learning signal.
